Reverse Polish Notation Calculator implemented using a LinkedStack. 
In addition to basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %), it supports some additional commands:
? to request that the entire current state of the stack be displayed.
. to display the top value on the stack without changing it. 
! to exit the program.
